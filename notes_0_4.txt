### EARMARK Data Structure (version 0.4) ###

# Bug fix

- deleted the method "generalIdentifierIsUsedBy" because it actually was a non-well-implemented 
duplicate of "getMarkupItemByGeneralIdentifier"

- changed the behaviour of "removeMarkupItem": now only the (directly or indirectly) dominated nodes 
of the input node are removed if and only if they are not dominated by other nodes that are not involved in the deletion

- handled Ranges with null begin and end locations

- now cloning an EARMARK document via "cloneNode" adds also the root nodes cloned to the document itself

- removed the non-useful interface "EARMARKNamedNode"

- now the it is possible to load automatically EARMARK documents linearised in Turtle

# Add-on

- a new test case (FrancescoPoggiTestOne) testing the previous bug fixes
