### TO DO

-- clone methods
Develop the clone method in all the classes that must have it.

-- locations
The current version (0.1) contains only the implementation of the CharNumberLocation. Moreover, 
the Range method "getTextContent" is now implemented handling only that kind of location. Note that
the implementation of the other ones is not straightforward, unless we perform, in some way,
a sort of reduction form the XPath/XPointer locations to the CharNumber one.

-- exceptions
All the exceptions defined does not have any JAVADOC comment: we need to add them.

-- external annotations
Add the possibility to load/store non-EARMARK annotations. Issue: what happens to all the non-EARMARK
annotations that concern an EARMARK item if, at certain point, I remove that item through the API?

-- docuverses
Even if the implementation of both the docuverses (StringDocuverse and URIDocuverse) exists,
there is not a mechanism in the URIDocuverse class to obtain the particular string referred by the URI
specified. For this reason, future development of this class regards the implementation of two new methods:
	* "getReferredContent" to obtain the real string content of the document referred by the URI,
	remembering to store this in an internal cache, to avoid the document downloading every time we 
	call this method;
	* "flush" to clean the internal cache.

-- loading and storing
The loading and storing mechanisms implemented in this version are quite trivial: they are based on
RDF/XML file written in a certain way. It does not exist any kind of checks to understand:
	* if the loaded file is EARMARK-well-formed (i.e., the EARMARK document is consistent against 
	the EARMARK ontology);
	* how to handle the different possible collection type declarations of a markup item, that could
	be explicitly declared as a a new rdf:Description or implicitly declared as a blank node in the
	markup item itself;
	* how to handle scenarios in which a markup item is two different collections;
	* etc.
