### EARMARK Data Structure (version 0.2) ###

Features of the current version:
- it is completely based on the EARMARK model version 1.6, available in http://www.essepuntato.it/2008/12/earmark and in http://palindrom.es/earmark, that is an OWL2 DL ontology;
- all markup items are now collections (http://swan.mindinformatics.org/spec/1.2/collections.html) of other items, in order to maintain EARMARK documents OWL2-DL-compliant. We can choose among sets, bags and lists;
- it implements a first validation mechanism for EARMARK documents based on Pellet 2.0 (http://pellet.owldl.com/);
- it is possible to store/load additional assertions into/from an EARMARK document, handling them by using the Jena RDF data model;
- the rationale behind the SWRL rules defined in the EARMARK ontology, that allow us to infer when a range/location is the same of another one, is completely supported by opportune Java methods.

## TODO
-- locations
The current version contains only the implementation of the CharNumberLocation. Moreover, 
the Range method "getTextContent" is now implemented handling only that kind of location. Note that
the implementation of the other ones is not straightforward, unless we perform, in some way,
a sort of reduction form the XPath/XPointer locations to the CharNumber one.

-- docuverses
Even if the implementation of both the docuverses (StringDocuverse and URIDocuverse) exists,
there is not a mechanism in the URIDocuverse class to obtain the particular string referred by the URI
specified. For this reason, future development of this class regards the implementation of two new methods:
	* "getReferredContent" to obtain the real string content of the document referred by the URI,
	remembering to store this in an internal cache, to avoid the document downloading every time we 
	call this method;
	* "flush" to clean the internal cache.
	
-- debug
Debug everything, in particular the methods for removing/cloning/adopting elements.
